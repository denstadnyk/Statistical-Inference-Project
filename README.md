We are going to analyze ToothGrowth data and perform some Exploratory and Basic Inferential Data Analysis with Student's t-test.

ToothGrowth data is a dataset from R datasets package. It gives information about the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in Guinea pigs.

Basic description of dataset:
The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, (orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).
